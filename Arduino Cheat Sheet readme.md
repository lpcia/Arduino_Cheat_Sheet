# Arduino Cheat Sheet

This is my version of an Arduino Cheat Sheet.  I wanted a version that I could edit myself.  Not finding one, I created this.  

I used it as a language familiarization exercise.  It has a lot of subjective thoughts on it, so I wanted to make it easy for anyone to edit.  

It was created in Apple Pages. I tried to export it to Word (DOC) format, but that probably isn't going to be very useful. In fact it may only print as desired on my printer.  In any case, at least you will have a head start on your own version.  I designed it to be quad fold.

I hope it is helpful.
